# Python Setup

There are several ways you can install Python and set up your computing environment.

I am using this project code running windows.


## 1. Download and install Conda

Download Anaconda on your system and create Virtual Enviroment for this project.

Link: https://www.anaconda.com/download | 

After downloading it, Copy the path where anaconda installed and add it to your system enviroment varibale 

## 2. Create a new virtual environment

After the installation was successfully completed, I recommend creating a new virtual environment called `LLMs`, which you can do by executing

Open Anaconda and write below command.

```bash
conda create -n LLMs python=3.12
```

> Many scientific computing libraries do not immediately support the newest version of Python. Therefore, when installing PyTorch, it's advisable to use a version of Python that is one or two releases older. For instance, if the latest version of Python is 3.13, using Python 3.11 or 3.12 is recommended.

Next, activate your new virtual environment (you have to do it every time you open a new terminal window or tab):

```bash
conda activate LLMs
```
